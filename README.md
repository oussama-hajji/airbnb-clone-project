# Airbnb Clone Project

## Project Overview
This project is an **Airbnb clone backend**, built to practice designing and implementing a scalable booking platform.  
It focuses on backend architecture, database design, API development, security, and CI/CD.

**Project goals:**
- Understand complex backend systems and team workflows.
- Build a robust RESTful API and secure backend services.
- Plan a scalable database schema.
- Learn modern development tools and deployment pipelines.

**Tech Stack:**
- Django
- MySQL / PostgreSQL
- GraphQL
- Docker
- GitHub Actions

## Team Roles

| Role                  | Responsibilities                                                                                   |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Backend Developer     | Build RESTful APIs, implement business logic, handle authentication/authorization, manage services. |
| Database Administrator| Design and optimize the database schema, handle migrations, backups, and performance tuning.        |
| DevOps Engineer       | Set up CI/CD pipelines, configure Docker containers, manage deployments to staging/production.      |
| Security Specialist   | Implement and audit API security (e.g., authentication, encryption, rate limiting).                 |
| Project Manager       | Coordinate tasks, plan sprints, and ensure the team meets deadlines and quality standards.          |

## Technology Stack

| Technology  | Purpose                                                                                         |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Django**  | Python web framework for building RESTful APIs and handling backend logic.                        |
| **MySQL** / **PostgreSQL** | Relational database to store user, property, booking, payment data securely.      |
| **GraphQL** | Provides a flexible API for clients to query data efficiently.                                   |
| **Docker**  | Containerization tool to package the application and dependencies for consistent deployment.     |
| **GitHub Actions** | Automate CI/CD: run tests, lint code, build Docker images, deploy to servers.            |

## Database Design

**Key entities and fields:**

- **User**: `id`, `name`, `email`, `password_hash`, `date_joined`
- **Property**: `id`, `owner_id`, `title`, `description`, `price_per_night`
- **Booking**: `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `check_in`, `check_out`, `status`
- **Review**: `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`
- **Payment**: `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `status`, `payment_date`

**Relationships:**
- A `User` can list multiple `Properties`.
- A `User` can make multiple `Bookings`.
- Each `Booking` belongs to one `Property` and one `User`.
- Each `Property` can have multiple `Reviews`.
- Each `Booking` can have one `Payment`.

---

## Feature Breakdown

- **User Management**: Sign up, log in, update profile, password reset â€” keeps user data secure and personal.
- **Property Management**: Hosts can list, update, and remove properties â€” provides flexibility to manage listings.
- **Booking System**: Users can search, book, and cancel stays â€” handles availability and date conflicts.
- **Payment Processing**: Securely process payments, track payment status, and issue refunds if needed.
- **Review System**: Users can rate and review properties â€” builds trust and improves quality.

---

## API Security

- **Authentication**: Verify user identity (e.g., JWT tokens).
- **Authorization**: Control access to resources (e.g., only hosts can edit their properties).
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse and protect APIs from spam.
- **Input Validation & Sanitization**: Prevent SQL injection, XSS, and other attacks.
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data like passwords (using hashing) and secure communications (HTTPS).

> Security protects user data, financial transactions, and ensures trust in the platform.

## CI/CD Pipeline

**What it is:**  
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) automates code testing, building, and deployment.

**Tools:**
- **GitHub Actions**: Run automated tests, linting, and build Docker images on each commit.
- **Docker**: Package and deploy the application in a consistent environment.

**Why it matters:**  
- Faster releases, fewer manual errors.
- Automatically catch bugs before production.
- Reliable and repeatable deployments.

## âœ… Next steps

- Commit and push this `README.md` to your `airbnb-clone-project` repo.
- Make sure itâ€™s clear and properly formatted in Markdown.

If you'd like, I can:
âœ… Create the initial repository with commands  
âœ… Help you write the `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`, or Dockerfile  
âœ… Help design actual models or APIs later

Just say: **"yes, help me create the repo & push"** or ask anything else! ðŸš€
